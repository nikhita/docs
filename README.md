# Kubernetes-CSI Documentation
Welcome to the Kubernets-CSI documentation reposotiory. Here you will find information on how to use, develop, and deploy CSI plugins, or drivers, with Kubernetes.

This is the repository for the book published on [kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/). The sources for the book are in the `book/` and it is setup to use [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook).

The `docs/` directory is the output of the book and the root of the published website. It is created by running `mdbook build` from the `book/` directory.
